This Project is a solution the problem of develop a game or a virtual reality whats simulates a futuristic spaceport, our solution is combining a part of hardware and software. Our hardware is a spider-robot controlled by a joystick with bluetooth to go forward, backward, rightward and leftward, just like we move the joystick. Then we put a camera in the front of the robot that will help us to see the environment and view an augmented reality with an application of android in the cell phone. The part of software consist to compose a code in python for connect the computer with the robot, in the same way we use a streaming of android that help us to see the video of the cameraÂ´s robot in the computer and put the augmented reality for have a futuristic experience in mars or in another spaceport of the galaxy.
